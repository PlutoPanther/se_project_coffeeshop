## Plan on improving the project

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to take a look at my project. I believe the project could be improved by adding "fixed" features when it comes to the nav. bar, logo and may be even hours of operation. Giving it more of a 3D feel by making background move slower than forefront when scrolling would be a cool addition.
